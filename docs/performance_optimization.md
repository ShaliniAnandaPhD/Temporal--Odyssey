# Performance Optimization

Temporal Odyssey is designed to provide an immersive and smooth gaming experience across a wide range of systems. However, depending on your system specifications and in-game settings, you may experience performance issues. This document provides tips and techniques for optimizing the game's performance and troubleshooting common issues.

## Performance Tuning Tips

1. **Adjust Graphics Settings**: Temporal Odyssey offers various graphics settings to balance visual quality and performance. If you're experiencing low frame rates or stuttering, try reducing the graphics quality, texture quality, or shadow quality in the game's settings menu.

2. **Update Drivers**: Ensure that your graphics card drivers are up to date. Outdated drivers can cause performance issues and compatibility problems. Visit your graphics card manufacturer's website (NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel) to download and install the latest drivers.

3. **Close Background Applications**: Running other resource-intensive applications in the background can impact the game's performance. Close unnecessary programs, web browsers, or streaming services while playing Temporal Odyssey to free up system resources.

4. **Enable Game Mode**: If you're running Windows 10, enable Game Mode to optimize your system for gaming performance. Game Mode prioritizes CPU and GPU resources for the game, reducing background activity and improving overall performance.

5. **Defragment Hard Drive**: If Temporal Odyssey is installed on a hard disk drive (HDD), regularly defragmenting the drive can improve loading times and overall performance. Use the built-in disk defragmentation tool in Windows or a third-party defragmentation utility.

6. **Overclock Components**: Advanced users with suitable hardware can overclock their CPU, GPU, or RAM to achieve higher performance. However, overclocking should be done with caution and proper knowledge, as it can lead to system instability and potential hardware damage if not done correctly.

## Debugging Tools and Techniques

If you encounter performance issues or bugs while playing Temporal Odyssey, you can use the following tools and techniques to diagnose and troubleshoot the problem:

1. **In-Game Console**: Press the tilde key (\`) to open the in-game console. The console displays debug information, error messages, and allows you to enter commands for troubleshooting purposes. Refer to the `temporal_odyssey/docs/console_commands.md` file for a list of available commands.

2. **Performance Overlay**: Enable the performance overlay in the game's settings menu to display real-time information about frame rate, CPU and GPU usage, memory consumption, and other performance metrics. This information can help you identify performance bottlenecks and optimize your settings accordingly.

3. **Crash Logs**: If Temporal Odyssey crashes or freezes, the game automatically generates a crash log file in the `temporal_odyssey/logs/` directory. These log files contain information about the crash, including error messages and system specifications. Please attach the relevant crash log file when reporting a crash to our support team.

4. **Profiling Tools**: Advanced users can use profiling tools such as NVIDIA Nsight, AMD Radeon GPU Profiler, or Intel VTune Amplifier to analyze the game's performance and identify optimization opportunities. These tools provide detailed insights into CPU and GPU usage, memory allocation, and other performance metrics.

## Benchmarking

Benchmarking allows you to measure the game's performance on your system and compare it with other configurations. Temporal Odyssey includes a built-in benchmarking tool that tests various aspects of the game's performance. To run a benchmark:

1. Launch Temporal Odyssey and navigate to the main menu.
2. Select "Benchmark" from the options.
3. Choose the desired benchmark settings, such as resolution, graphics quality, and duration.
4. Click "Start Benchmark" and wait for the test to complete.
5. Once the benchmark finishes, a results screen will display your system's performance metrics, including average frame rate, minimum and maximum frame rates, and CPU/GPU usage.

You can compare your benchmark results with other users on the Temporal Odyssey community forums or online performance databases to see how your system stacks up.

If you encounter any performance issues or have questions about optimization techniques, please consult the Temporal Odyssey community forums or contact our support team for further assistance.
