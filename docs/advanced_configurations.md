# Advanced Configurations

Temporal Odyssey allows players to customize various aspects of the game to suit their preferences and optimize performance. This document provides an overview of the configuration files and settings available for advanced users.

## Configuration Files

The game's configuration files are located in the `temporal_odyssey/configs/` directory. The main configuration files include:

- `settings.ini`: Contains general game settings, such as display resolution, graphics quality, audio levels, and control bindings.
- `physics.ini`: Allows customization of physics engine parameters, such as gravity, collision detection, and object properties.
- `ai.ini`: Provides options for configuring AI behavior, difficulty levels, and custom scripts.

To modify a configuration file, open it in a text editor and change the desired settings following the provided comments and examples. Be cautious when making changes, as incorrect values may lead to unexpected behavior or game instability.

## Environment Customization

Temporal Odyssey supports the creation of custom environments and scenarios using the provided tools and templates. To create a custom environment, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `temporal_odyssey/environments/` directory.
2. Create a new folder with a descriptive name for your custom environment.
3. Inside the new folder, create a file named `environment.json` to define the environment's properties, such as terrain, objects, and lighting.
4. Place any custom assets (models, textures, sounds) in the appropriate subfolders within your environment folder.
5. Use the provided tools, such as the level editor or scripting API, to define the gameplay elements, objectives, and interactions within your environment.

Refer to the documentation in the `temporal_odyssey/docs/environment_creation.md` file for detailed instructions on creating custom environments.

## Modifying Existing Environments

In addition to creating custom environments, you can also modify the existing environments to add new challenges, objects, or features. To modify an existing environment:

1. Navigate to the `temporal_odyssey/environments/` directory and locate the folder of the environment you want to modify.
2. Open the `environment.json` file in a text editor to make changes to the environment's properties.
3. Add, remove, or modify objects, terrain, or other elements as desired.
4. Update any associated scripts or gameplay elements to reflect the changes made to the environment.

Be sure to test your modifications thoroughly to ensure they don't introduce any unintended consequences or break the game's functionality.
