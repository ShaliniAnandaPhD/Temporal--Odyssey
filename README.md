## Key Features

- Immersive time travel experience across multiple eras
- Dynamic, evolving environments
- Multimodal agent capabilities with era-specific actions
- Intelligent reward system
- Adaptive challenges
- Advanced learning techniques (PPO, A3C, transfer learning, meta-learning)
- NPC interactions and quest system

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- `pip`
- `virtualenv` (recommended)
- Certain dependencies might have specific version requirements. Check `requirements.txt` for details.

## Installation

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShaliniAnandaPhD/Temporal-Odyssey.git
cd Temporal-Odyssey
```

### Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Install the required dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

To run a basic simulation:

1. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd temporal_odyssey
    ```

2. Run the main script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

This will start a basic simulation using default settings. You'll see output describing the agent's actions and rewards as it navigates through different time periods. Expect to see how the agent adapts and learns in dynamic environments with era-specific challenges.

## Advanced Usage

To customize the simulation or use specific learning techniques:

```python
from temporal_odyssey.envs.time_travel_env import TimeTravelEnv
from temporal_odyssey.agents.ppo_agent import PPOAgent
from temporal_odyssey.models.transfer_learning import TransferLearning

# Create environment and agent
env = TimeTravelEnv(start_era="prehistoric", difficulty="hard")
agent = PPOAgent(env, learning_rate=0.001)

# Initialize transfer learning
transfer_model = TransferLearning()

# Train the agent
agent.train(num_episodes=1000, transfer_model=transfer_model)

# Test the agent
agent.test(num_episodes=100)
```

For more detailed examples and API documentation, refer to the `docs/` directory.

## Concepts

- **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)**: An advanced reinforcement learning algorithm that balances exploration and exploitation.
- **A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic)**: A deep reinforcement learning algorithm that uses asynchronous gradient descent for more efficient learning.

## Data and Models

### Data

To access necessary data files:

1. Ensure you have the `data/` directory in your project root.
2. Download the required datasets from [this link](https://example.com/datasets) and place them in the `data/` directory.
3. Alternatively, generate synthetic data using provided scripts in the `scripts/` directory:

    ```bash
    python scripts/generate_data.py
    ```

### Models

To access or generate models:

1. Pre-trained models can be downloaded from [this link](https://example.com/models).
2. Place the downloaded models in the `models/` directory.
3. Train your own models using the provided training scripts:

    ```bash
    python temporal_odyssey/models/train_model.py
    ```

## Troubleshooting

- **Common Issues**:
  - *Installation errors*: Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
  - *Runtime errors*: Check the configuration files and paths.
  - *Data errors*: Ensure data files are correctly placed in the `data/` directory.

For detailed troubleshooting, refer to the `docs/troubleshooting.md`.
