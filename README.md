## Key Features

- Immersive time travel experience across multiple eras
- Dynamic, evolving environments
- Multimodal agent capabilities with era-specific actions
- Intelligent reward system
- Adaptive challenges
- Advanced learning techniques (PPO, A3C, transfer learning, meta-learning)
- NPC interactions and quest system

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- `pip`
- `virtualenv` (recommended)

## Installation

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShaliniAnandaPhD/Temporal-Odyssey.git
cd Temporal-Odyssey
```

### Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Install the required dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

To run a basic simulation:

1. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd temporal_odyssey
    ```

2. Run the main script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

This will start a basic simulation using default settings. You'll see output describing the agent's actions and rewards as it navigates through different time periods.

## Advanced Usage

To customize the simulation or use specific learning techniques:

```python
from temporal_odyssey.envs.time_travel_env import TimeTravelEnv
from temporal_odyssey.agents.ppo_agent import PPOAgent
from temporal_odyssey.models.transfer_learning import TransferLearning

# Create environment and agent
env = TimeTravelEnv(start_era="prehistoric", difficulty="hard")
agent = PPOAgent(env, learning_rate=0.001)

# Initialize transfer learning
transfer_model = TransferLearning()

# Train the agent
agent.train(num_episodes=1000, transfer_model=transfer_model)

# Test the agent
agent.test(num_episodes=100)
```
