# Temporal Odyssey

Temporal Odyssey is an immersive reinforcement learning project inspired by H.G. Wells' "The Time Machine." As an agent, you will navigate through distinct time periods, facing unique challenges and dynamic environments that test your adaptability and survival skills. This project emphasizes the multimodal nature of its agents, allowing for rich interactions and learning across various sensory inputs and outputs.

## Key Features

- **Travel through history:** Journey from the primitive past to a technologically advanced future.

### Dynamic Environments
- **Interact with evolving environments:** Your actions shape the world around you.
- **Engage with objects and characters:** Influence your surroundings through interaction.

### Multimodal Agent Capabilities
- **Era-specific actions:** Perform tasks suited to each time period.
  - **Primitive past:** Navigate terrains, gather resources, craft tools, and build shelters.
  - **Present:** Trade goods and make strategic decisions.
  - **Dystopian futures:** Scavenge supplies and navigate dangers.
- **Multisensory learning:** Utilize visual, auditory, and textual data to enhance agent decision-making and adaptability.

### Intelligent Reward System
- **Sophisticated rewards:** Encourage exploration and survival.
- **Consequential actions and decisions:** Your choices shape your path through history.

### Adaptive Challenges
- **Evolving obstacles:** Challenges grow with your learning progress, ensuring continuous growth and replayability.

## Getting Started

To begin your adventure through time:

1. **Run the Temporal Odyssey environment and train your agent:**
   ```python
   from temporal_odyssey.envs.time_travel_env import TimeTravelEnv
   from temporal_odyssey.agents.ppo_agent import PPOAgent
   from temporal_odyssey.agents.a3c_agent import A3CAgent
   from temporal_odyssey.models.transfer_learning import TransferLearning
   from temporal_odyssey.models.meta_learning import MetaLearning

   env = TimeTravelEnv()
   ppo_agent = PPOAgent(env)
   a3c_agent = A3CAgent(env)
   transfer_learning = TransferLearning()
   meta_learning = MetaLearning()

   # Train the agents using advanced techniques
   ppo_agent.train(transfer_learning, meta_learning)
   a3c_agent.train(transfer_learning, meta_learning)
   ```

2. **Customize your agent:** Experiment with different learning algorithms.
